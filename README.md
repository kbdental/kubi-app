# KuBi — Clinic Operating System

Operational app for K.B. Dental Clinic. Runs the clinic day from opening
through to closing, telling staff what needs doing and why.

## Run it

Open `KuBi.html` in a browser. No server, no install, no internet needed —
React is bundled in.

## Build it

```bash
npm install
npm run build     # compiles src/ -> KuBi.html
npm test          # builds, then runs 37 journey checks + 7 bundle checks
```

`KuBi.html` is generated. Edit `src/`, never the bundle.

## Structure

```
src/
  # data + logic (plain JS, no JSX)
  i18n.js              English/Hindi strings — every user-visible word
  roles.js             9 roles, categories, area access
  mockData.js          Employees, attendance, operatingDate() helper
  clinicReadiness.js   Opening checklist, room mapping
  clinicClosing.js     11-item closing gate (5 critical)
  patientCheckIn.js    Appointments, journey stages, follow-ups
  treatmentChecklists.js  27 procedures, before/after, closure gate
  attention.js         What needs attention, with owner + reason
  equipment.js         Equipment status list
  sterilization.js     Instrument pack chain
  inventory.js         Materials mapped to procedures
  nextAction.js        THE PRIORITY ENGINE — one action from 8 states
  mis.js               Management KPI computation
  history.js           Daily snapshots + trends (STORAGE ADAPTER HERE)

  # screens (JSX)
  Today.jsx  Clinic.jsx  Patients.jsx  Treatment.jsx
  MIS.jsx  Management.jsx  AttendanceModule.jsx  EmployeeMaster.jsx
  App.jsx              Shell, all shared state, navigation
```

## Two rules that hold the design together

**One priority engine.** `nextAction.js` consumes all eight state inputs
and emits exactly one recommended action. Features must feed this engine
rather than inventing their own "what's next" logic.

**Never expose internals.** Staff see: what to do, is it ready, what's
missing, what's next. Component names, state keys and the four internal
closure categories stay behind the screen. All user-facing text lives in
`i18n.js`.

## Build hazard worth knowing

`build.js` uses **function replacers**, not string replacements, when
injecting code into the HTML. This is deliberate: JavaScript's
`String.replace()` treats `$$`, `` $` ``, `$&` and `$'` as escape
sequences, which silently corrupts React's source (it contains
`$$typeof`) and produces a bundle that fails with
`Invalid or unexpected token` and `ReactDOM is not defined`.

`test-bundle.js` loads the built file and catches exactly this class of
fault — the journey test compiles `src/` directly and cannot see it.
Keep both in `npm test`.

## Known limitation

`history.js` stores daily snapshots **in memory** — they clear on reload,
so MIS trends stay empty in practice. To make history real, replace the
four methods in `historyStore` (`all`, `get`, `put`, `remove`) with real
storage. Nothing else changes.
